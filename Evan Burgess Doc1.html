			<h2>Finally, time for cookies.</h2>
	
			<p>
				Did I bake 
				<a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b9/Chocolate_Chip_Cookies_-_kimberlykv.jpg">cookies</a> 
				this morning?  Yes.  Yes I did.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				They are Seven-Layer Cookies.  Seven layers, seven ingredients.  In this order:
			</p>
		
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.draxe.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/butter.jpg">Butter</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://realsustenance.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/graham_crackers.jpg">Grahm-Cracker Crumbs</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.lafujimama.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Sweetened-Condensed-Milk.jpg">Sweetened Condensed Milk</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.benefityourlifestore.com/images/Chocolate%20Chips.jpg">Chocolate Chips</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://site.nutsinbulk.com/yswimages/butterscotch-chips-1-pound.jpg">Butterscotch Chips</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://thebarefootkitchenwitch.typepad.com/the_barefoot_kitchen_witc/images/2008/04/21/img_0593_2.jpg">Coconut</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.foodpoisonjournal.com/uploads/image/Atlas%20walnut%20recall.jpg">Walnuts</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>
				Now, you may be thinking, "Okay, that's nice, but how much of each ingredient do I need?", 
				and I would respond in the following manner:
			</p>
			
			<table border="1">
				<tr>
					<td>Ingredient</td>
					<td>How much you should use</td>
					<td>How much <em>I</em> use</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Butter</td>
					<td>One stick</td>
					<td>Butter only comes in sticks.  Just use one.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Grahm Cracker Crumbs</td>
					<td>A cup and a half</td>
					<td>I don't have a measuring cup.  Use one package, blus two additional crackers.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Sweetened Condensed Milk</td>
					<td>One Can</td>
					<td>Just one can.  It's too much work to open another.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Chocolate Chips</td>
					<td>Half a package</td>
					<td>Three quarters of a package, and just eat the rest.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Butterscotch Chips</td>
					<td>Half a package</td>
					<td>Same as with the chocolate chips.  Try eating them together.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Coconut</td>
					<td>Half a package</td>
					<td>Just half of a package.  Save the rest for the next batch.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td>Walnuts</td>
					<td>Half a package</td>
					<td>A bit less than half a package.  I leave a few spots without nuts.</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
						
			<p>
				Bake, cool (for <em>four hours</em>), cut, and serve.

			<h2>Enough with cookies; time for plaster.</h2>
		
			<p>
				I made a plaster neighborhood last night.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				It was a neighborhood in this area:

			<h2>What now, you ask?</h2>
			
			<p>
				I happen to be creating this document in 
				<a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/">TextWrangler</a> 
				right now.  This is how it looks:

			<img src="images/screen1.jpg"
				title="My latest screenshot"

			<p>
				This is the line that I am working on at the moment:

			<img src="images/screen2.jpg"
				title="this line"
				alt="I actually wrote this line a little while ago."
				Width="700"
				Height="226"

			<p>
				And this is what it looks like now that I added the image:
